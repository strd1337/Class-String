# Class-String
Create a class String - a string using dynamic memory. Define Operators "+" – addition of strings, "=" and "+=" – assignments, like class methods. Define Operators comparisons "==", "!=", "<", ">" as friend functions. Operators must work both with String and char*. Define "[]" operator to access each character in separately. Overload I/O statements into a stream.
